THE PONG PROJECT

This is my Pong Project in Python.
The purpose of this project is to simulate the Pong Arcade Game.
The project was done in Python using PyCharm IDE and the "turtle" graphics library.


The educational purpose of this project, besides learning python,
is to learn and master the OOP concepts such as inheritance, working with objects,
initialising an object, creating new instances of the classes and organising the code
into classes in a very orderly manner.

Besides stimulating  the learning of OOP Concepts, this project also made me learn to work 
with the turtle library in python.

The structure of the project is organised in 4 files:
	-One main file for running the code and creating new instances 
	-three separate files for the classes:
		-The Ball Class     -> The blueprint for the ball object
		-The Paddle Class   -> The blueprint for the player paddles
		-The Scoreboard Class -> The blueprint for the scoreboard object

The project has a simple structure, the emphasis being on the OOP concepts and the Turtle Library.

Attached, i left the source code of the project, on my git Repo.
