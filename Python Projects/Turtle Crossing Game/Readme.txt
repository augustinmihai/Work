#THE TURTLE CROSSING GAME PROJECT


This project is made in python with the PyCharm IDE.
The purpose of the project is to simulate a crossing the street game.

The structure of the project:
	the project is made from 4 different python files:
		-1 file is called the "main" file, used for creating class instances and running the game
		- Other 3 files are made for the blueprint of the classes:
					->the player file containing the Player class blueprint
					->the car_manager file containing the Car manager class blueprint
					->the scoreboard file containing the scoreboard class blueprint
					
The educational purpose of the project is to learn Python and OOP concepts.
The emphasis is being set on Object Oriented Programming in Python and OOP concepts
such as inheritance, class methods, class instances and so on.

Also, this project helps us to learn working with Turtle library, the emphasis being set on OOP.

Attached, there is my source code of the project.
