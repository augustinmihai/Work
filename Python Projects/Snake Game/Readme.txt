This is my "Snake Game" project made in python.
This project was made using PyCharm IDE and also the python + Turtle library in python.

The purpose of this project is to learn the OOP concepts in Python.

Besides this, another purpose of the project is to lean the Turtle Graphics library in python 
and also to learn to work with text files in python(write, delete, and read data from a text file using python).

The structure of the project:
	->1 main file for running the game and the code(also for creating new instances of the classes)
	->3 additional files containing the classes:
		-one file for the snake classes
		-one file for the "food" class
		-one file for the scoreboard class
		
Attached, i left the source code for the project.
